# Gargoyle

Forged from stone and bound by forgotten magic, gargoyles were once silent sentinels, statues carved into sacred places to serve in perfect stillness. Awakened by arcane command, they acted as watchmen, wardens, or warriors under the will of another. Yet in rare instances, something changes; a fracture in their enchantment, a surge of chaotic energy, a whisper from a forgotten power, and the stone begins to think. When this spark of awareness takes hold, a gargoyle becomes something new: no longer a servant, but a free-willed being seeking its own path.

### Gargoyle Traits

**Creature Type:** Humanoid. You are also considered a construct for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be a construct.   
**Size:** Medium (about 6-7 feet tall).  
**Speed:** 30 feet  
:
As Gargoyle, you have these special traits.  

**Darkvision:** You have Darkvision with a range of 120 feet.

**Stone-Forged Body.** Your stone body gives you a natural strength and resiliency to attacks. Your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Constitution modifier plus your Proficiency Bonus. You can't wear light, medium, or heavy armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield's bonus as normal. You cannot swim, and you sink immediately when submerged in water unless supported by external forces or magic. You are considered Large for any purposes that involve detemrining your ability to drag, lift, or push.

**Living Stone.** You have Resistance to Poison damage and Advantage on saving throws to avoid or end the Poisoned and Petrified conditions.

You do not need to eat, drink, or breath, though you may do so if you wish.

**Sentry's Rest.** Instead of sleeping, you enter a motionless resting state for 6 hours during a Long Rest. While in this state, you are completely still and appear to be a lifeless stone statue, but you are fully aware of your surroundings, and you can see and hear as normal. 

**Stony Guise.** While you remain completely motionless and silent, you are indistinguishable from an inanimate stone statue. Creatures with a passive Perception lower than your passive Stealth won't give you a second look. A creature that closely inspects you must make an Intelligence (Investigation) check with a DC equal to 8 plus your Charisma modifier plus your Proficiency Bonus. On a success they discern that you are a living creature.

**Wings of Stone** Your wings, carved of stone, grow stronger as your form awakens:

**Glide.** While you are in the air and not Incapacitated with a Speed higher than 0, you can extend your wings to Glide. While you Glide, your rate of descent slows to 15 feet per round. You may move horizontally up to your remaining Speed and you must move at least half of your Speed horizontally on each of your turns, or you Dive a number of feet equal to your Speed. You can only carry one creature or object with a size of Small or smaller, otherwise you cannot Glide.

**Dive.** While you Dive, you temporarily retract your wings to increase your rate of descent. You can descend this way up to twice your remaining Speed.

You can alternate between Glide and Dive at any time. If you Glide horizontally for at least 10 feet at a height of no more than 10 feet before landing, you take no fall damage. 

**Burst Flight.** When you reach character level 3, you can use your wings to leap high into the air. As a Bonus Action, you gain a Fly Speed equal to your Speed until the end of your turn. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. At character level 5, you gain a Fly Speed equal to twice your Speed until the end of your turn.
