Stone Sentry. This traditional artwork, likely created with charcoal or pastels, features a menacing gargoyle perched atop an ancient stone structure, drawn in shades of gray with hints of brown and beige in the background. The intricately detailed creature stands out with its sharp features, glowing eyes, bat-like wings, and muscular build, while expressive brushstrokes and a moody atmosphere accentuate the intense, dramatic composition.
